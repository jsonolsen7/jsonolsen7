## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Nice to meet you! I'm Jason, a Software engineering student at nology.io and soon to be Jr. Test engineer at ASML in San Diego, CA.

## A Little About Me

I started my software engineering career a little over a year ago when I signed up for UCSD Extension's full-stack web development bootcamp and have loved coding ever since. In particular, I love CSS, JavaScript, and ReactJS, but after working on the Jack-in-the-Box website as a web dev intern at Bounteous, I love SCSS too! I'm very excited to be working for nology.io/ASML because I'll learn much more about test engineering/Python and have the opportunity to work on such an advanced technological product. All in all, I'm really glad that I've found this field because it combines all the skills and knowledge from my previous two careers and opens the doors for so much more.

As a biological researcher, I was organized, methodical, and was always looking for innovative ways to improve the experiment's results. As a high school science teacher, I was challenged to think more creatively, to act with more empathy, and to model the best ways to communicate and collaborate with others. I believe these careers have made me well-prepared to become a software engineer because they require similar amounts of diligence and creativity. I am constantly being challenged, always learning, and excited to work in a field that has such limitless potential to make the world a better place.

When I'm not coding, I try to get outdoors as much as possible, spend quality time with my friends and family, and tend to my seemingly ever-growing plant collection. My cat, Martini, loves that I can work from home now and I'm very excited to see where this career will take me!
 
## My Projects 

1. <a target=_blank href=https://jaolsen7.github.io/json-portfolio/>My Professional Portfolio</a> - Made with React and SCSS, this project is intended to highlight what I've learned through the bootcamp at UCSD and the internship at Bounteous. It is a single-page, mobile-responsive application that utilizes HTML, SCSS, ReactJS, SwiperJS, EmailJS and React Icons. [Link to Github](https://github.com/jaolsen7/json-portfolio)
2. <a target=_blank href=https://github.com/jaolsen7/plant-swap>Plant Swap Lite</a> - This project is a mobile-responsive MERN application that connects plant lovers in the same zip code for houseplant exchanges. This CRUD app allows users to post their favorite plant species and comment on other users posts in order to communicate if they want to swap. Live demo/Heroku deployment no longer working...
3. TBD

### All projects should containing a readme explaining, 
1. What the project does
2. Requirements
3. How to use it, installation steps etc
4. Technologies used
5. Considerations you had to make (how you approached the project)
6. All this should be backed up by screenshots

Here's an example project readme - [Example ReadMe](https://github.com/nology-tech/Example-RM)

## My Work - This should be where you link to the code your challenge solutions

### Week 1

#### HTML - Link to separate repo containing challenges, this repo should contain a readme that has screenshots of project and an overview of what you learned in class. Remember screenshots!

#### CSS 

#### Flexbox & Grid

#### SCSS

### Week 2
